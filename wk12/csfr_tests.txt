Test Summary: CSRF Prevention

A CSRF token is included as a hidden field in the form and compared to a server-side session variable.

With csfr_form.php, the session generates a token that is sent along with the form. The server processes the request because the token is a session variable.

Attempting to send the same request from the csfr.html page, which does not have a token, results in a failed request. The token value is incorrect, causing the server to reject the request.

This method effectively prevents forged requests, as an attacker cannot predict or replicate the CSRF token because it is randomly created for each session.
