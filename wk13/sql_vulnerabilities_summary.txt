Testing getusers_1.php

1) Input: Ben  
No results are shown because Ben is inactive. The active = 1 filter work correctly.

2) Input: Ben'--  
It shows Ben even when is inactive. The code is vulnerable because the -- ignores the active filter.

3) Input: Ben' or 1=1  
Displays all active users. The code is vulnerable and executes the condition or 1=1 as true



Testing getusers_2.php

1) Input: Ben  
It's not showing any results. So, the filter is working fine.

2) Input: Ben'--  
It doesn't show results. The injection doesn't work because it uses prepared statements.

3) Input: Ben' or 1=1  
No results are displayed. The query is protected against SQL injections.
